# TUI Inventory Management System

A comprehensive Terminal User Interface (TUI) based inventory management system built with Go and Bubble Tea, designed for point of sale integration.

## Quick Start with Dev Container

1. **Prerequisites**: VS Code with Dev Containers extension
2. **Setup**: 
   - Open this project in VS Code
   - Run "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" from Command Palette
   - Wait for container to build (includes Go 1.23 + PostgreSQL 16)
3. **Verify Setup**:
   ```bash
   go version  # Should show Go 1.23+
   psql -h postgres -U inventory_user -d inventory_db -c "SELECT version();"
   ```

## For New Claude Sessions

**IMPORTANT**: Read `CLAUDE.md` first - it contains the complete project plan, architecture, and development roadmap.

## 🚀 Automated Development with GitHub Actions

This project includes automated development workflows that can be triggered manually to continue frontend and backend development:

### Available Workflows
- **`/frontend-next`** - Continue React frontend development (next pending task)
- **`/backend-pos-next`** - Continue backend POS system implementation (next pending task)

### How to Use
1. Go to **Actions** → **Claude Development Tasks** in GitHub
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select task type (`frontend-next` or `backend-pos-next`)
4. Choose target branch
5. Add optional custom instructions
6. The workflow will execute the next task and push changes automatically

📋 **Progress Tracking**: `FRONTEND_PROGRESS.md` and `BACKEND_POS_PROGRESS.md`  
📖 **Full Documentation**: `.github/CLAUDE_DEV_WORKFLOW.md`

### Running the Application

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   go build -o tui-inventory ./cmd/main.go
   ```

2. **Seed the database** (first time only):
   ```bash
   ./tui-inventory --seed
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   ./tui-inventory
   ```

### Default Credentials
After seeding, you can use these test accounts:
- Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
- Manager: `manager` / `manager123`
- Staff: `staff` / `staff123`
- Viewer: `viewer` / `viewer123`

### Architecture Overview
