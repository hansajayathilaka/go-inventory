# Vehicle Spare Parts Shop - Next Step Command

Execute the next step in the vehicle spare parts shop development process (Phase 6.5 & Phase 7).

## Usage
```
/next-step
```

## What it does
1. Reads the current progress from `REVAMP_PROGRESS.md`
2. Identifies the next pending step in Phase 6.5 or Phase 7
3. Implements the step following existing code patterns
4. Updates the progress file with completion status
5. Commits the changes with descriptive commit message
6. Stop on a stable stage

## Current Phase 6.5: Testing & Documentation (Concurrent with Phase 7)

### Phase 6.5: Testing & Documentation 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- Step 6.5.1: Comprehensive end-to-end testing
- Step 6.5.2: Update documentation and commands

## Current Phase 7: API Response Standardization & Frontend Integration

### Phase 7.1: API Response Analysis & Planning ✅ COMPLETE
- Step 7.1.1: Identify API response inconsistencies ✅
- Step 7.1.2: Document standardized response structure ✅

### Phase 7.2: Backend API Response Standardization 🚧 IN PROGRESS
- Step 7.2.1: Create unified response DTOs (Current)
- Step 7.2.2: Update Product APIs with standardized responses
- Step 7.2.3: Update Supplier APIs with standardized responses
- Step 7.2.4: Update Category APIs with standardized responses
- Step 7.2.5: Update User & Vehicle APIs with standardized responses

### Phase 7.3: Frontend Integration Updates 📋 PENDING
- Step 7.3.1: Update frontend API service layer
- Step 7.3.2: Fix affected frontend components
- Step 7.3.3: Update TypeScript types

### Phase 7.4: Testing & Validation 📋 PENDING
- Step 7.4.1: Test all affected API endpoints
- Step 7.4.2: Test all affected frontend components
- Step 7.4.3: Integration testing

## Critical Issues Being Resolved
- ❌ **JavaScript Runtime Errors**: `m.map is not a function` in Purchase Receipt creation and Compatibility management
- ❌ **API Response Inconsistencies**: 6 different pagination formats across endpoints  
- ❌ **Frontend Type Mismatches**: Components expecting arrays but receiving nested objects
- ❌ **Data Access Patterns**: Inconsistent property paths for accessing paginated data

## System Status
**✅ Backend Complete**: 95+ API endpoints, JWT auth, role-based access, unified PurchaseReceipt system
**✅ Frontend Navigation Complete**: Unified Vehicle Management, optimized navigation structure (14→10 items)
**🚧 Phase 6.5**: Testing and documentation for completed navigation features
**🚧 Phase 7**: API standardization to resolve response structure inconsistencies causing runtime errors
**📋 Current Task**: Create unified response DTOs to standardize all API responses

## Target Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Success message",
  "data": [...],
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 100,
    "total_pages": 5
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-08-31T12:00:00Z"
}
```

The command will automatically determine which step to execute next based on the progress tracking file.
