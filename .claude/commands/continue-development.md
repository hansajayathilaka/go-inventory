# Continue Hardware Store Inventory Development

Continue developing the Go + React embedded inventory system from where we left off.

## Usage
```
/continue-development
```

## What this command does:
1. Reads PROGRESS.md to understand current development state
2. Checks existing React frontend and Go API implementation
3. Automatically starts the next logical task in the development plan
4. Tests that implemented features work correctly with both development and production builds
5. Updates PROGRESS.md with new progress status

## Current Architecture:
- **Backend**: Go API with Gin framework (48+ REST endpoints)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Vite
- **Deployment**: Single 33MB executable with embedded React build
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLite option for standalone
- **Target**: Single-user hardware store inventory system

## Current Development Phases:
- ‚úÖ **Phase A**: React Frontend Migration (COMPLETED)
- üéØ **Phase B**: Category Management UI (CURRENT PRIORITY)
- ‚è≥ **Phase C**: Product Catalog Management  
- ‚è≥ **Phase D**: Inventory & Store Operations
- ‚è≥ **Phase E**: Advanced Features & Production Polish

## Files it manages:
- `PROGRESS.md` - Development progress tracking
- `frontend/` - React TypeScript application
- `internal/api/router/` - Go API endpoints
- `internal/embed/` - React build embedding
- `build/` - Development and production build scripts
- `hardware-store-inventory` - Single executable binary

## Development Commands Available:
- `./build/dev.sh` - Development mode with hot reload
- `./build/build.sh` - Production build creation
- `./hardware-store-inventory --seed` - Initialize with demo data
- `./hardware-store-inventory` - Run production mode

## What it focuses on:
- Feature-complete React UI components with modern UX
- Real-time API integration with proper error handling
- Responsive design optimized for hardware store workflows
- Single executable deployment suitable for old computers
- Comprehensive form validation and user feedback

No test cases required - focuses on functional verification that features work end-to-end.
