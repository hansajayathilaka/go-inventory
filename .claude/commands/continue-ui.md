# Continue UI Development

Continue developing the Go + HTMX + Templ UI from where we left off.

## Usage
```
/continue-ui
```

## What this command does:
1. Reads PROGRESS.md to understand current development state
2. Checks existing codebase for completed implementations  
3. Automatically starts the next logical task in the UI development plan
4. Tests that implemented features work correctly
5. Updates PROGRESS.md with new progress status

## Current Development Plan:
- **Phase 1**: Project Setup & Foundation (templ, HTMX, basic structure)
- **Phase 2**: Authentication & Layout System  
- **Phase 3**: Core Inventory Features
- **Phase 4**: Advanced Features & Polish

The command will pick up exactly where development was left off and continue with the next task in sequence.

## Files it manages:
- `PROGRESS.md` - Progress tracking
- `internal/web/` - Web handlers and templates
- `web/static/` - CSS, JS assets
- Go dependencies for web UI

No test cases will be written - just functional verification that features work.
