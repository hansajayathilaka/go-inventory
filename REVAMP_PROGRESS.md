- ❌ **Data Access Patterns**: Inconsistent property paths for accessing paginated data

## Navigation Issues Identified & Solutions

### Current Issues (14 scattered navigation items):
```
❌ Current Navigation (Messy):
- Dashboard
- Products  
- Categories
- Inventory
- Customers
- Part Brands        } Should be grouped
- Vehicle Brands     } under "Vehicle 
- Vehicle Models     } Management"
- Compatibilities    } 
- Purchase Receipts
- Suppliers
- POS Ready (placeholder)
- Admin (Users)
- Audit Logs
```

### Target Navigation Structure (Clean):
```
✅ Target Navigation (Clean):
- Dashboard
- Products (with integrated compatibility attributes)
- Categories  
- Inventory
- Vehicle Management (dropdown)
  ├── Part Brands
  ├── Vehicle Brands  
  ├── Vehicle Models
  └── Compatibility Matrix
- Customers
- Purchase Receipts
- Suppliers
- Admin (Users)
- Audit Logs
```
