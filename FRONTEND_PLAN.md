# React Frontend Implementation Plan for Hardware Store Inventory System

## Project Overview
Building a comprehensive React frontend for the existing Go backend inventory management system. The system manages vehicle spare parts inventory, customer relationships, brand management, vehicle compatibility tracking, and unified purchase receipt processing.

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for build system  
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui for component library
- React Router for navigation
- React Hook Form for forms
- TanStack Query for API state management
- Zustand for global state (auth, theme)

## Key Design Decisions

### Components Strategy:
- Use shadcn/ui for base components (Button, Input, Dialog, etc.)
- Create reusable business components (ProductCard, StockBadge, StatusBadge)
- Implement data tables using shadcn/ui Table with sorting/filtering
- Use React Hook Form for all forms with TypeScript validation

### State Management:
- TanStack Query for server state (API data, caching, mutations)
- Zustand for client state (auth, theme, cart for POS)
- Local state with useState for component-specific state

### Styling Approach:
- Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Custom CSS variables for theming
- Monospace fonts for codes/IDs (`font-mono` class)
- Consistent color scheme (neutral for hardware store feel)

### API Integration:
- Axios-based service layer with interceptors
- JWT token management with auto-refresh
- Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- Request/response TypeScript interfaces matching backend DTOs

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process:
1. `npm run build` creates optimized React bundle
2. Go embed directive includes dist/ folder in binary
3. Gin serves React files for non-API routes
4. Single executable deployment with embedded frontend

### Development Workflow:
- Use `./build/dev.sh` for full-stack development
- Frontend hot reload on port 5173
- Backend API on port 9090
- Proxy API calls from frontend to backend

## Available Backend API Endpoints (95+)

### Authentication & Users
- POST /api/v1/auth/login
- POST /api/v1/auth/logout
- GET /api/v1/auth/me
- CRUD operations for users with role management

### Product Management
- Full CRUD for products with search and filtering
- Category hierarchy management
- Brand association
- Barcode support
- POS-ready product lookup

### Inventory Management
- Stock level tracking
- Stock adjustments
- Low stock and zero stock alerts
- Stock movement history

### Purchase Receipts
- Unified order/receipt workflow
- Status management (draft → pending → approved → ordered → received → completed)
- Item management within receipts
- Supplier performance tracking

### Master Data
- Customer management with codes and credit limits
- Supplier management
- Brand management (separate from vehicle brands)
- Vehicle brands and models
- Vehicle compatibility tracking

### Reporting & Audit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Stock movement reports
- Inventory summaries
- System statistics

This plan provides a systematic approach to building a comprehensive hardware store inventory management system, emphasizing simplicity, reusability, and maintainability with monospace styling for technical elements.
