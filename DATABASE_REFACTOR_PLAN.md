# Database Refactor Implementation Plan

## Overview
Transform the current complex database schema to a minimal, efficient design based on the simplified ERD. Focus on essential functionality for a small shop operation with 2 users.

## Current State Analysis

### âœ… Existing Models (13 files)
1. **Keep As-Is**: `user.go`, `category.go`, `brand.go`, `supplier.go`, `customer.go`, `inventory.go`, `stock_movement.go`, `audit_log.go`
2. **Simplify**: `purchase_receipt.go` (remove approval workflow fields)
3. **Add Missing**: Sales tables, Stock Batches, Payments
4. **Remove**: `vehicle_*.go` files (3 files - can be added later)

### ðŸ”´ Models Needing Changes
- `purchase_receipt.go` - Remove complex workflow fields, keep only essential
- `product.go` - Review for unnecessary complexity
- Missing: `sale.go`, `sale_item.go`, `payment.go`, `stock_batch.go`
